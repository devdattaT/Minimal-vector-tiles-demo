# Minimal-vector-tiles-demo

This repo contains the code that was written during the 'Serving PostGIS data as Vector Tiles' seminar for Geo Bharat.

You can watch the Video here: [Serving PostGIS data as Vector Tiles - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5N9qKCMzg)

To run this, you need the following:

 - A PostGIS Database
 - The database should have a districts layer, and a roads layer. 
 - [Martin](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) 
 - A Mapbox Account. Get a token from there, and add it in the JavaScript code.
